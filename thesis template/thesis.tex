  This document is a template and guide for writing a thesis in \LaTeX. The document is divided into sections explaining the preferred way of typesetting equations, figures, tables, and more. To prepare your thesis, simply edit the file \texttt{thesis.tex} along with the chapters in the \texttt{chapter/} folder. To make the final pdf, open a command prompt, navigate to the folder containing the template, and run the following commands:
  
  \texttt{pdflatex thesis.tex}\\
  \texttt{bibtex thesis.aux}\\
  \texttt{pdflatex thesis.tex}\\
  \texttt{pdflatex thesis.tex}
